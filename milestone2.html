  <h2>Narrative</h2>
  <p>In this milestone, I worked on improving the Inventory Management App I had created in my CS-360 Mobile Architecture course. It’s a basic Android app written in Java that allows users to log in, create accounts and manage inventory. I already had working functionality but I was aware that the code wasn’t very organized or easy to build on further as everything was jammed into the activity, which made it difficult to change or expand anything.</p>
  <p>I decided to clean things up using the MVC design pattern. I moved the database related code into a UserModel class, put the app logic in a separate Controller class, and left the UI handling in the MainActivity. I also replaced hardcoded strings in the layout with proper string resources and added comments to make the code easier to understand and follow. Overall, it’s a lot more modular and organized now and feels more professional.</p>
  <p>This task helped me get a better understanding of software structure and what makes code maintainable. It was a little challenging to refactor without breaking things as I was working with a decent amount of working code, but I tested throughout the process which helped me quickly resolve errors/issues as I encountered them. I feel a lot more confident in how to split and refactor code and build apps that are easier to manage which I know is extremely important in real-world development. </p>
