  <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>

  <p>Hi, I’m Ahnaf, and this ePortfolio showcases the work I’ve done throughout my computer science program, with a focus on a mobile app I built and enhanced for inventory management. My goal here is to highlight my ability to apply core computer science skills across software design, algorithms and data structures, and databases — all through a real working project.</p>

  <p>This app started out as a basic Android application I made in CS-360. Over time, I enhanced it by cleaning up the code structure using MVC principles, improving the way the app handles inventory search using smarter logic and more reliable data handling, and fixing how it interacts with the SQLite database so it reflects real-time changes. These changes gave me a deeper understanding of things like modular code design, data lookup efficiency, and secure, accurate database interaction. I also gained more confidence working in Android Studio, planning code changes, and debugging edge cases.</p>

  <p>Through this project, I’ve demonstrated my ability to build clean, functional, and maintainable software. I’ve hit all five program outcomes — from software engineering and design, to applying secure practices, working with data, and thinking critically through the code review process. I’m proud of how far the app has come, and this portfolio gives a clear picture of the kind of developer I’m growing into.</p>
