  <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>

  <p>Hello! I’m Ahnaf, and this ePortfolio showcases the work I’ve done throughout my computer science program focusing on a mobile application I built and enhanced for inventory management. My goal is to highlight my ability to apply core computer science skills with respect to software design, algorithms and data structures, and databases through a functional project.</p>

  <p>The application initially started out as a basic Android application I made for my CS-360 course. For this course (CS-499), I enhanced it by cleaning up the code structure using MVC principles, improving the way the app handles inventory search using smarter logic and more reliable data handling, and fixing how it interacts with the SQLite database so it reflects real-time changes. I further tested, identified issues and fixed them. These changes gave me a deeper understanding of things like modular code design, efficiency in terms of data lookup and secure and accurate database interaction. Working through the enhancements/improvements, I gained more confidence in Android Studio, planning code changes, and debugging edge cases.</p>

  <p>Through this project, I’ve demonstrated my ability to build clean, functional, and maintainable software. I’ve covered different areas from software engineering and design, to applying secure practices, working with data, and performing code review process. I’m excited to see how far the app has come, and this portfolio gives a clear picture of the kind of work I have learned throughout my journey.</p>
