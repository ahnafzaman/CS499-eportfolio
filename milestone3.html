  <h2>Narrative</h2>
  <p>In Milestone Three, I stuck to the same Inventory app, this time I focused on performance. Specifically, I optimized the way the app looks up inventory items. Originally, it used a basic for loop to search through an ArrayList, which isn’t very efficient as the list gets bigger. To fix this, I added a HashMap to store inventory items by name, which allows users to instantly find any item using its name as the key. That change alone made the search feature feel a lot organized and scalable.</p>
  <p>I also added a new delete feature to make the app more useful. Each inventory item in the list now has a Delete button which removes the item from both the app’s display and the underlying database. This added feature made me think more carefully about keeping the UI and data model in sync, and how to properly update the adapter when something changes. Along with the HashMap, dynamic updates like adding, searching, or deleting items can be handled efficiently.</p>
  <p>This milestone definitely helped me get more confident with choosing and implementing the right data structure for a given situation. The HashMap gave me a simple but efficient way to improve performance, and wiring up the delete logic made me better at coordinating between the data layer and the UI. I'm satisfied with how these enhancements came together and it’s current state. Even though I’m sure further enhancements and additions can be made to this part in the future, I have gained practical skills I know I will need in any kind of real-world app development.</p>
